# Company Handbook

## This frontend is part of a project for a company handbook. Core features are:

- rudimentary login/register functionality with spring security 
- viewing articles with different versions
- workflow for approving/denying articles
- role based access to certain features, e.g. a non-admin can create and edit articles, while an admin can do the same, but has the ability to approve/deny articles
- rich text editor (tinyMCE) for formatting text
